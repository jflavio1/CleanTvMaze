But change is afoot at Downton — change far surpassing the new electric lights and telephone. A crisis of inheritance threatens to displace the resident Crawley family, in spite of the best efforts of the noble and compassionate Earl, Robert Crawley ; his American heiress wife, Cora his comically implacable, opinionated mother, Violet and his beautiful, eldest daughter, Mary, intent on charting her own course. Reluctantly, the family is forced to welcome its heir apparent, the self-made and proudly modern Matthew Crawley himself none too happy about the new arrangements. As Matthew's bristly relationship with Mary begins to crackle with electricity, hope for the future of Downton's dynasty takes shape. But when petty jealousies and ambitions grow among the family and the staff, scheming and secrets — both delicious and dangerous — threaten to derail the scramble to preserve <em>Downton Abbey</em>. Created and written by Oscar-winner Julian Fellowes, <em>Downton Abbey</em> offers a spot-on portrait of a vanishing way of life.</p>","updated":1492891839,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/251"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/215207"}}},{"id":252,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/252/girl-meets-world","name":"Girl Meets World","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Comedy","Family"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"premiered":"2014-06-27","schedule":{"time":"18:00","days":["Friday"]},"rating":{"average":8.1},"weight":1,"network":{"id":78,"name":"Disney Channel","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":{"id":83,"name":"Watch Disney Channel","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"externals":{"tvrage":33436,"thetvdb":267777,"imdb":"tt2543796"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/50/126868.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/50/126868.jpg"},"summary":"<p><strong>Girl Meets World</strong> is based on ABC's hugely popular sitcom, Boy Meets World (1993).

Out of this chaos emerges a new hero: Jane Vasco, a.k.a. Painkiller Jane. Once the DEA's top agent, Jane Vasco is formidable, both mentally and physically. As a child, her father nicknamed her Painkiller Jane, describing her ability to mentally push through even the most painful situations. But her strength is about to be tested. Jane is recruited by a covert government agency dedicated to containing and, if necessary, neutralizing the threat of \"Neuros\" — individuals with superhuman neurological powers. No one knows what caused the aberrations that led to their enhanced abilities, which range from from telekinesis and telepathic suggestion to induced hallucinations. During her first investigation with her new team, Jane discovers that she too possesses an odd ability: she can't be killed. Unfortunately, she can still feel pain. Her newfound powers make Jane even more determined to learn everything there is to know about Neuros. Seldom malicious, Neuros often can't control their powers. Consequently, they tend to leave a trail of death and destruction. To prevent a panic, the government has kept the discovery of Neuros a secret, assembling a covert unit to identify and contain Neuros. Operating from a secure abandoned subway platform, the core members of the unit are Andre McBride, the seasoned team leader; Connor King, a special agent regularly armed with a smart remark; Riley Jensen, an evolved computer whiz in charge of surveillance and communications; Dr. Seth Carpenter, the unit's doctor and scientist; Joe Waterman, the middle-aged caretaker of the subway; and Maureen Bowers, Jane's former DEA partner and friend, who, like Jane, was recruited after discovering top-secret information about Neuros. Painkiller Jane is based on the comic-book series of the same name created by Jimmy Palmiotti and Joe Quesada.</p>","updated":1482854805,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/484"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/43815"}}},{"id":485,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/485/day-break","name":"Day Break","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Science-Fiction","Thriller"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2006-11-15","schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Wednesday"]},"rating":{"average":8.5},"weight":0,"network":{"id":3,"name":"ABC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":8152,"thetvdb":79509,"imdb":"tt0801425"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/3/9395.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/3/9395.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Detective Brett Hopper is having a hellacious day; the kind of day where nothing goes his way and he just cant wait to put it behind him... only he cant, because hes living the same day over and over again.

The distrust of the boy has little to do with the boy himself, but it's what's inside him that causes anxiety. Long before Naruto came to be, a Kyuubi (demon fox) with great fury and power waged war taking many lives. The battle ensued for a long time until a man known as the Fourth Hokage, Yondaime, the strongest ninja in Konoha, fiercely fought the Kyuubi. The fight was soon won by Yondaime as he sealed the evil demon in a human body. Thus the boy, Naruto, was born. As Naruto grows he decides to become the strongest ninja in Konoha in an effort to show everyone that he is not as they perceive him to be, but is a human being worthy of love and admiration. But the road to becoming Hokage, the title for the strongest ninja in Konoha, is a long and arduous one. It is a path filled with betrayal, pain, and loss; but with hard work, Naruto may achieve Hokage.</p>","updated":1489176704,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/495"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/45225"}}},{"id":496,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/496/100-things-to-do-before-high-school","name":"100 Things to Do Before High School","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Comedy","Children"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"premiered":"2015-05-30","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Saturday"]},"rating":{"average":7},"weight":0,"network":{"id":27,"name":"Nickelodeon","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":44057,"thetvdb":288148,"imdb":"tt3904078"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/12/31612.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/12/31612.jpg"},"summary":"<p><strong>100 Things to Do Before High School</strong> was created by Big Time Rush executive producer and creator Scott Fellows, this new show will follow three best friends as they navigate the highs and lows of middle school, with the help of a bucket list of adventures that help them overcome class cliques, terrifying bullies and clueless teachers.
